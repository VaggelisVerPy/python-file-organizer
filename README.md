Python File Organizer

This is a Python automation script that organizes files inside a folder into category subfolders such as Images, Documents, Audio, Video, Archives, Code, and Others based on file extensions.
It scans the entire folder recursively and safely moves files while avoiding name conflicts.

The .zip file contains the main python project and a readme.md file
